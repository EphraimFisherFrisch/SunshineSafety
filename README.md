# The Problem

1 in 5 Americans will be affected by skin cancer at some point in their life. The leading cause of skin cancer is overexposure to UV light, which can be easily prevented by applying and appropriately reapplying sunscreen. Overexposure to UV light in lesser amounts causes sunburns. Despite this, 56% of Americans rarely, if ever, remember to apply and reapply sunscreen, which would prevent harmful overexposure to UV light. Additionally, caused by heat, 518,000 Americans are hospitalized each year due to dehydration. 

# Our Solution

Our goal is to help people protect themselves from both sunburns and dehydration, so they can enjoy being outside, even on hot summer days, risk-free. To accomplish this, we designed the Sunshine Safety, a bracelet that will remind you to drink water and reapply sunscreen, based on your activity and surroundings. With the help of Sunshine Safety, your risk of dehydration, sunburning, and tanning should be decreased, even if you spend the whole day in the sun.
